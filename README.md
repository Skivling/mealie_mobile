# Maize

Maize is a sleek and modern [Mealie](https://github.com/mealie-recipes/mealie) client, written in [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) and specifically designed for mobile devices. Due to its design, snappy interface and deep integration it feels right at home on any supported device.

## Features:

- Explore and manage your recipes and shopping lists
- Create new recipes manually or from URLs that are supported by Mealie

## Download

Currently only in Alpha Release stage, links will be added when a complete version becomes available

## Roadmap

Things to implement before i would consider Maize feature complete:

- Categories, Tags, Tools, Foods, and Units
- Timeline

- Importing from Image and ZIP

A list of features that I would love to have implemented for a V2 release:

- Improved "offline" functionality
- Dark Mode!
- Administration Tools
- Language support
- Advanced Searching

### Planned platforms
