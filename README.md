# Maize

Maize is a sleek and modern [Mealie](https://github.com/mealie-recipes/mealie) client, written in [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) and specifically designed for mobile devices. Due to its design, snappy interface and deep integration it feels right at home on any supported device.

## Features:

- Explore and manage your recipes and shopping lists
- Create new recipes manually or from URLs that are supported by Mealie

## Warning

## Download

Currently only an [alpha release](https://github.com/young-hnau/maize/releases/latest) is available. See how to sideload it below.

Direct links to official app stores will be added here when a stable release becomes available.

## Roadmap

Things to implement before i would consider Maize feature complete:

- Advanced Searching

### Planned platforms
